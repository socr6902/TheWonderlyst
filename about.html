          <p>I’m Traci, and I write The Wonderlyst. </p>

<p>For as long as I can remember, I have loved discovering new things and sharing them with others. At the intersection of art, beauty, and nature is where I am happiest, and where my curiosity thrives. </p>

<p>At the suggestion of many friends, two years ago, I began sharing ideas for cultivating wonder through The Wonderlyst. This weekly guide to wonder features everything worth a look, a listen, a read, a taste, a lust, a think, or a journey. It was born out of my (almost) insatiable curiosity and a belief that wonder and awe are not indulgences, but essential forces that help us feel more alive, more connected, and more hopeful.</p>

<p>Research increasingly shows what many of us feel intuitively: moments of wonder can reduce stress, spark creativity, deepen empathy, and expand our sense of possibility. I see this play out every week in the notes I receive from readers who feel re-energized, inspired, or simply reminded to look up.</p>
<h3>WHAT IS THE WONDERLYST?</h3>

<p>Each week, I send out a dozen wonder-filled ideas that will have you bookmarking websites and social feeds, filling up your calendar, podcast queue, music library, and stacking your nightstand.</p>

<h3>WHAT DO I GET AS A PAID SUBSCRIBER?</h3>

<p>You'll receive a full Lyst each week, which includes a dozen ideas for cultivating wonder in your life. These Lysts include recommendations for TV shows and films to watch, podcasts to listen to, books to read, music to check out, a new restaurant or dish to try, an art exhibit to see, and much more. While I live in Los Angeles and there is a focus on this city, each week there is plenty for those who live elsewhere (I have subscribers all over!).</p>

<p>You will also receive special Guest Curated Lysts about 6 times a year, featuring people whose taste I admire and want to share with you.  And, I send out travel Lysts dedicated to different cities around the world.</p>

<p>If you join the Wonder Circle, you will get all of this PLUS access to my Concierge service, invitations to events, and special gifts.</p>

<p>I am convinced we all need more wonder in our lives. If The Wonderlyst helps you slow down, look closer, or feel a little more open to the world around you, then it's doing exactly what it was meant to do.</p>
